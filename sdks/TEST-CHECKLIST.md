# Shre SDK v2.0.0 — Test Checklist

**Test Execution Date:** [DATE]  
**SDK Version:** 2.0.0 (locked, May 2, 2026)  
**Status:** [PASS | FAIL]

---

## Overview

This checklist ensures ALL SDKs (iOS, Android, Web, Python, .NET) pass the same 40+ contract tests that validate the 4 locked endpoints.

**What's being tested:**

- POST /v1/events/batch — Event batching
- POST /v1/sdk/session — Authentication
- GET /v1/sdk/config — Configuration
- POST /v1/sdk/heartbeat — Device liveness

**Why it matters:**
Contract tests prevent breaking changes. Every test must pass on every platform, or the change is blocked at CI.

## Failure Investigation

### If tests fail:

1. **Check endpoint status**

   ```bash
   curl -I https://api.shre.ai/health
   curl -I https://events.shre.ai/health
   ```

2. **Check for breaking changes**
   - Did any response field name change?
   - Did any required header get removed?
   - Did any HTTP method change?

3. **Check contract spec**
   - Review `contracts.test.json` for expected schema
   - Compare actual response to expected schema

4. **Review changelog**
   - Check `docs/SDK-VERSION-MANAGEMENT.md` for recent changes
   - Check `CHANGELOG.md` for deprecations

### Common failures:

| Symptom                     | Cause                                | Fix                                        |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| "Missing required header"   | x-shre-tenant or x-shre-app not sent | Verify request headers match spec          |
| "Invalid JSON response"     | Server returned HTML on error        | Check endpoint for errors                  |
| "Unexpected response shape" | Response field was renamed/removed   | Update test expectations + update all SDKs |
| "401 Unauthorized"          | Token expired or invalid             | Re-bootstrap session                       |
| "429 Rate Limited"          | Too many requests too fast           | Reduce test concurrency                    |
| "Timeout"                   | Network latency or endpoint down     | Check endpoint health, increase timeout    |

## Platform-Specific Notes

### JavaScript/Web

- **Framework:** Vitest (Vitest + fetch mocking)
- **File:** `__tests__/ShreSDK.test.ts`
- **Run time:** ~8s
- **Coverage:** 40+ tests covering all endpoints, error cases, serialization
- **Node versions:** 18+ (SDK requires native fetch)

### iOS/Swift

- **Framework:** XCTest (runs in `shre-router` Node test suite for contract validation)
- **File:** `shre-router/src/routes/__tests__/sdk.test.ts`
- **Run time:** ~5s
- **Coverage:** 40+ tests (shared with all platforms)
- **Note:** Contract tests run on backend; iOS SDK tests run in Xcode

### Android/Kotlin

- **Framework:** JUnit 4
- **File:** `sdks/kotlin/src/test/kotlin/**SdkContractTest.kt`
- **Run time:** ~10s
- **Coverage:** 40+ tests
- **Dependencies:** Mockito, OkHttp MockWebServer

### Python

- **Framework:** pytest
- **File:** `sdks/python/tests/test_sdk.py`
- **Run time:** ~7s
- **Coverage:** 40+ tests
- **Dependencies:** pytest, requests-mock

### .NET/C#

- **Framework:** NUnit or xUnit

- **Dependencies:** HttpClientFactory, Moq

---

## Continuous Integration

All SDKs are tested in CI/CD on every commit.

### Pre-commit hook (local)

```bash
scripts/validate-sdk-contracts.sh
```

Runs all SDK tests. If any fail, commit is blocked.

### GitHub Actions (CI)

- **Trigger:** Push to `main` or pull request
- **Jobs:** JavaScript, iOS, Android, Python, .NET (in parallel)
- **Timeout:** 5 minutes per platform
- **Failure:** Blocks merge until all tests pass

### Quality gate

If tests fail in CI:

1. Change is immediately blocked
2. Author is notified
3. Change cannot be merged until tests pass
4. Tests must be updated first to document breaking changes

## Updating Tests

If you need to change an endpoint:

1. **Update the contract spec** (`contracts.test.json`)
2. **Update ALL SDK tests** (JavaScript, iOS, Android, Python, .NET)
3. **Document the change** in `docs/SDK-VERSION-MANAGEMENT.md`
4. **Announce deprecation** (if breaking)
5. **Version bump** in `package.json` + all SDK version files
